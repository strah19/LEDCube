Directions for PCB!!!

All the needed files have been generated by me already. These files are located under `cube/gerber.zip`. There are many different
companies that can make the PCB. You are welcome to choose whatever one you would like. They will allow accept the generated files so
that should not be a concern. I suggest JLCPCB because of the low cost. For this PCB they quoted me at $12 for 5 boards. I have also used 
them before with good results. On whatever website you choose, you'll just have to add the gerber files and all the settings should be good
to go. Nothing on our part has to be done. Below is a screenshot of what the PCB will look like. Let me know if there is something you want 
changed and I will before you buy it. Thanks!
