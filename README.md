# LEDCube

Directions for PCB!!!

All the needed files have been generated by me already. These files are located under `cube/gerber.zip`. There are many different
companies that can make the PCB. You are welcome to choose whatever one you would like. They will all accept the generated files so
that should not be a concern. I suggest JLCPCB because of the low cost however it is from China so it may take some time to deliver. 
For this PCB they quoted me at $12 for 5 boards. I have also used them before with good results. On whatever website you choose, you'll 
just have to add the gerber files and all the settings should be good to go. Nothing on our part has to be done. Below is a screenshot 
of what the PCB will look like. Let me know if there is something you want changed and I will before you buy it. Thanks!

### Notes
- You will have to buy IC sockets for the chips.
- The resisitors for the LED's, NOT the ones connected to transistor base pin, should all be between 220 and 330 ohms.
- For the arduino, please use female header pins and then pop the arduino in. This way the arduino can be easily taken out.
- To the left of the arduino, there is a header. These are connected to the arduinos analog pins and are there so they are available for use (possibly a button).
- Also to the left of the arduino there is a place for a capacitor. The capacitor is there to protected it from noise. IMPORTANT: if you are using a polarized capacitor,
  meaning one side is supposed to be positive and the other negative, the right hole is the negative and the left hole is the positive. Usually, the capacitor legs will be
  different lengths, the longer one is positive and the shorter one is negative. I suggest this capacitor be valued around 10 - 100 uF, whatever you have.
- The pinout of the transistors is VERY important. I'm not sure what transistors you have but this is the following pin out they need to have (check the datasheet): 1: emitter, 2:base,
  and 3: collector. This can also be seen in the schematic (pdf). These transisitors are PN2222A's. If you have these great, otherwise just check the datasheet of the ones you have and if
  they have the same pinout they can work. Also, make sure they are oriented the correct way when placing them on the board (the emitter is directly connected to ground, this can be verified    with a multimeter).
- Lastly, on top of each chip, there is a place for a capacitor. Please use ceramic capacitor that is NOT polarized and has a value of 0.1 uF. These are also filter capacitors.
